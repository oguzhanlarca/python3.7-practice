Interfaces represent a capability.
Abstract classes represent a type,
         that another class can inherit from.
Inheritance - Is a relationship between obj.
Aggregation - Has a relationship between obj.
Composition - Implies Ownership.

Syntax for inheritance in C++ different
from most other languages because 
a class can inherit from multiple levels in C++.

A concrete class has no children .

When method types are shared, used an interface
instead of an abstract class.

How are the contents of a composition 
different from those of an aggregation? 
// If a composition dies, the contents die.
